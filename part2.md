# Part 2
## Testing the sample

This sample project has a basic page for login and a navigation system. We can now view this on our mobile device, in a browser, or in an emulator. In the last section we ran `expo start` and should now see a screen like the following:

On the left hand side we see a list of our devices. Towards the middle of the sidebar, we see buttons that let us run the app on our Android device/emulator, iOS device/emulator, and in the browser.

One of the quickest ways to test your app on a mobile device is by using the QR code at the bottom. Start by downloading the Expo App onto your phone.

### In the app
Once you have the app open, click on the button **Scan QR Code** on Android or the **+** in the navbar on iOS. Scan the QR code, and *VIOLA*! Your app is now loading on your phone! When we open the app we should see the following:
